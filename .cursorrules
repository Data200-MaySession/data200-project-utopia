## Movie Success Predictor Frontend Development

**Overall Goal:** Build a modern, creative frontend for a machine learning project that predicts movie success (hit or flop).

**Tech Stack:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.

**Key Features:**
- Quiz-style interface for guessing movie success.
- Integration with TMDB API for movie posters.
- Visually appealing, interactive, and accurate UI.
- Communication with a Python backend for ML predictions.

**Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure**
[X] 1. Initialize React + TypeScript project using Vite.
[X] 2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS.
[X] 3. Install `axios` for API calls.
[X] 4. Clean up default Vite/React files.
[X] 5. Create basic folder structure (`src/components`, `src/pages`, `src/services`, `src/assets`, `src/hooks`, `src/types`).

**Phase 2: Core UI Components**
[X] 1. Create `MovieCard` component (`src/components/MovieCard.tsx`).
[X] 2. Create `QuizControls` component (`src/components/QuizControls.tsx`) (for "Hit"/"Flop" buttons).
[X] 3. Create `ScoreDisplay` component (`src/components/ScoreDisplay.tsx`).
[X] 4. Create `FeedbackMessage` component (`src/components/FeedbackMessage.tsx`).

**Phase 3: Page Layout & API Integration (Simulated Backend)**
[X] 1. Design `QuizPage` (`src/pages/QuizPage.tsx`) to orchestrate components.
[X] 2. Create `tmdbService.ts` (`src/services/tmdbService.ts`) to fetch movie data.
    [X] Implement function to get movie details and poster.
    [X] User updated TMDB API Key.
[X] 3. Create `backendService.ts` (`src/services/backendService.ts`) with placeholder functions for:
    [X] Getting a movie to guess.
    [X] Submitting a guess and getting the prediction & actual result.
[X] 4. Implement basic state management in `QuizPage` (current movie, score, user's guess, feedback).

**Phase 4: Styling & Interactivity**
[X] 1. Apply Tailwind CSS styles to all components for a modern and creative look.
[X] 2. Add animations/transitions for better user experience.
[X] 3. Ensure responsive design.
[X] 4. Troubleshoot and resolve Tailwind CSS styling application issues (including downgrade to v3 and tsconfig fixes).

**Phase 5: UI Refinement (Premium Look & Feel)**
[X] 1. Refine UI/UX based on the "fun, intelligent quiz game" concept and "premium" feel.
[X] 2. Enhance `App.tsx` (background, title).
[X] 3. Enhance `MovieCard.tsx` (background, border, shadows, image loading, title, hover).
[X] 4. Enhance `QuizControls.tsx` (shape, size, gradients, shadows, text, hover/active).
[X] 5. Enhance `FeedbackMessage.tsx` (background, text, shadow, border, icons).
[X] 6. Enhance `ScoreDisplay.tsx` (background, border, shadow, typography).
[X] 7. Enhance loading and error states in `QuizPage.tsx`.

**Phase 6: Backend Development & Integration**
[X] 1. Develop Python backend (Flask, ML model integration, API endpoints).
    [X] Created `backend/` directory, `requirements.txt`.
    [X] Created `backend/train_model.py` to train and save Logistic Regression model and dummy columns.
    [X] Created `backend/app.py` with Flask API endpoints (`/api/quiz/next-movie`, `/api/quiz/submit-guess`).
[X] 2. Update `backendService.ts` to connect to the live Python backend.
    [X] Updated `BACKEND_API_URL` to `http://127.0.0.1:5001/api`.
    [X] Implemented real API calls for `getMovieToGuess` and `submitGuess`.
    [X] Adjusted frontend data types (`QuizMovieFromBackend`) and `QuizPage.tsx` to handle poster path from backend and construct full URL using `tmdbService`.
    [X] Resolved `tsconfig.app.json` issues for async/await and JSX compilation.
[ ] 3. (Optional) Further UI/UX enhancements based on new backend data or features.

**Phase 7: Testing & Deployment**
[ ] 1. Implement unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library).
[ ] 2. Implement integration tests.
[ ] 3. Prepare for deployment.
