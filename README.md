# Data 200 Applied Statistical Analysis  
## Project Work  
**"Exploring Real-World Data through Statistical and Predictive Modeling"**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains the ongoing work for our DATA 200 Applied Statistical Analysis project. The primary objective is to apply statistical and predictive modeling techniques to a real-world dataset to extract meaningful insights and develop a simple end-to-end application. As of Week 4, we have completed initial data acquisition, comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and selection of statistical models.

## üìä Dataset

**Name**: `moviesDb.csv`
**Source**: This dataset is derived from the `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` dataset, originally retrieved from Kaggle.
**Description**: The dataset contains various attributes of movies, including budget, revenue, runtime, genre, country, release date, and vote counts. It has been preprocessed to ensure data quality and suitability for statistical modeling, with additional features like 'year' and 'success' added during the cleaning phase.

## ‚è∞ Project Deliverables and Progress (Up to Week 4)

We have diligently followed the project timeline and achieved the following milestones:

### **Week 1: Group Formation and Topic Finalization**
*   Formed our project group and finalized the topic: "Exploring Real-World Data through Statistical and Predictive Modeling" with a focus on movie data.
*   Identified the problem statement related to movie success prediction and analysis.

**Deliverables:**
*   **Project Idea Presentation**: Our initial proposal outlining the project scope and objectives.
    *   [`project-idea-presentation/Project-Proposal-Presentation.pdf`](project-idea-presentation/Project-Proposal-Presentation.pdf)

### **Week 2: Literature Review and Dataset Selection**
*   Conducted a literature review to establish context and relevance for movie data analysis.
*   Selected the `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` dataset from Kaggle, which is then processed into `moviesDb.csv`.

**Deliverables:**
*   Submission of at least 3 literature reviews of related works (integrated into project understanding).

### **Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Preprocessing**
*   Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using descriptive statistics and visualizations. The code for this EDA, covering various visualizations and analysis steps as planned for Week 3, is available in `eda_analysis.py` or `visualization.ipynb` file.
*   **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented robust data cleaning techniques as detailed in `data_cleaning.py`. This included:
    *   Dropping duplicate entries.
    *   Removing unusable entries based on `runtime`, `revenue`, `budget`, `adult`, `year`, and `vote_count` criteria.
    *   Handling missing values by replacing null `certification_US` with 'NR' and null `genre` with 'None'.
    *   Creating a `year` column from `release_date`.
    *   Generating a `success` column (True if `revenue >= budget * 2`, False otherwise).
    *   Extracting the first `genre` and `country` from their respective lists.
    *   Filtering out countries with low frequency to ensure data quality.
    *   Sorting data by `release_date`.
    *   Removing redundant features like `original_title`, `release_date`, `adult`, `popularity`, `genres`, `status`, `production_companies`, and `production_countries`.

**Deliverables:**
*   EDA code script: [`eda_script.py`](eda_script.py) (Code for EDA, ready for notebook integration).
*   Cleaned dataset: [`moviesDb.csv`](moviesDb.csv) generated by [`data_cleaning.py`](data_cleaning.py).

### **Week 4: Statistical Model Selection and Detailed Hypothesis Testing**
*   Selected appropriate statistical techniques based on the project problem statement (e.g., Hypothesis testing, Regression for predictive modeling).
*   Developed and conducted detailed hypothesis tests regarding factors influencing movie success using `hypothesis_testing.py`. These tests include explicit null and alternative hypotheses, assumptions, test statistics, p-values, effect sizes (Cohen's d, Cramer's V), and detailed interpretations for the following relationships:
    *   Budget vs. Success
    *   Genre vs. Success (Top 15 Genres)
    *   Vote Average vs. Success
    *   Runtime vs. Success
    *   Vote Count vs. Success
    *   Certification (US) vs. Success
    *   Country vs. Success (Top 10 Countries)
*   Prepared the Mid-Defense Presentation.

**Deliverables:**
*   Detailed Hypothesis Testing script: [`hypothesis_testing.py`](hypothesis_testing.py)
*   **Mid-Defense Presentation**: A slide deck justifying our model and feature choices.
    *   [`project-idea-presentation/Mid-Defense-Presentation.pdf`](project-idea-presentation/Mid-Defense-Presentation.pdf)

## üìà Future Work (Beyond Week 4)

*   **Week 5: Statistical Analysis and Validation (Continued)**: Continue with further inferential statistical analysis, perform diagnostics on models, refine interpretations, and validate hypotheses more rigorously. Explore regression modeling.
*   **Week 6: Statistical Modeling (Regression) & Report Compilation**: Build regression models for predictive analysis, finalize insights from all statistical analyses, and begin compiling the comprehensive project report.
*   **Week 7: Application Development**: Create a simple Python application for project demonstration.
*   **Week 8: Peer Evaluation and Final Presentation**: Conduct peer evaluations, prepare and present final findings, and submit the final report.
